# Web-Design-Challenge

With the help from my tutor we created the syle.css and created a local css file for bootstrap. In the index file I linked both the bootstrap local and my created stylesheets. 

I created the navbar and made it mobile friendly and created 6 empty html files to use as placeholders in the navbar code. In the navbar I had a link to the landing page, a drowndown with 4 pages, a comparison page and a data page. Once the navbar was fully functioning I copied and pasted it to all the subsequent html files.  

On the landing page I created two sections with images and text. The most noteable accomplishment on this page was when I linked the images under the visulaization section to thei html pages. 

In the Plot dropdown pages I created two sections. The first section is the description and image of the specific weather trend. The second section was a copy and paste from the visulaization section on the landing page. The most noteable accoplishment on these pages was highlighting the image that corresponded with the page. 

The data page was probably my favorite. I used pandas to_html function to convert the csv file to html - and pandas created the table code that I copied and pasted into the data html file.
